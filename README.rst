How to install and run
----------------------

You need to provide the Kivy framework with its dependencies
(or Kivy Launcher).  Then you will be able to run the game.

To do that download Kivy and follow the instructions accessible
at http://kivy.org/#download

The main script/program of the game is, naturally, the `main.py`
file.


How to play
-----------

Drag and drop the bricks to form one or more valid equalities
(e.g. `2+2=3-1`).  All given bricks should be used.  There is
always at least one valid solution.
