How to install and run
----------------------

You need to provide the Kivy framework with its dependencies
(or Kivy Launcher).  Then you will be able to run the game.

To do that download Kivy and follow the instructions accessible
at http://kivy.org/#download

The main script/program of the game is, naturally, the *main.py*
file.

Up to now the game has been tested only on Linux but let's hope
it works on other platforms as well. (That was the intention.) :)


How to play
-----------

Use the slider at the bottom to choose the difficulty level;
then press *New game*.

Drag and drop the bricks to form one or more valid equalities
(e.g. *11-2=3+6*).  All given bricks should be used.  There is
always at least one valid solution.
